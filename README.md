# HACKvent 2019
What is [HACKvent](https://hackvent.hacking-lab.com/)?  
HACKvent is a white-hat hacking competition in the "capture the flag" style, provided by Hacking-Lab. Every day in December until the 24th, a new challenge is released, much like an Advent calendar.
## Challenge level "easy"
[Day 01: HV19.01 censored](01)  
[Day 02: HV19.02 Triangulation](02)  
[Day 03: HV19.03 Hodor, Hodor, Hodor](03)  
[Day 04: HV19.04 password policy circumvention](04)  
[Day 05: HV19.05 Santa Parcel Tracking](05)

Still need more time to compile the notes for the other challenges into a proper write-up.
