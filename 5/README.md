# Day 05: HV19.05 Santa Parcel Tracking
Yes, I really liked this one.  
>To handle the huge load of parcels Santa introduced this year a parcel tracking system. He didn't like the black and white barcode, so he invented a more solemn barcode. Unfortunately the common barcode readers can't read it anymore, it only works with the pimped models santa owns. Can you read the barcode?
